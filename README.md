#Shopping Cart Example Code

In class I discussed 3 different strategies to create new products:

* Node by node with separate functions. (1 for name, 1 for price, 1 for input, 1 for subtotal.)
* Using string interpolation (backticks: ``) and .innerHTML
* .cloneNode

Only .cloneNode was demonstrated until completion.
